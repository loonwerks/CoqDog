CoqDog: Alright, let's prove the lemma `skipn_app` by induction on `n`. 

Here is how we can structure the proof:

```coq
Lemma skipn_app n:
    forall l1 l2: list A,
      skipn n (l1 ++ l2) = (skipn n l1) ++ (skipn (n - length l1) l2).
Proof.
  induction n; intros l1 l2.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - destruct l1.
    + simpl. rewrite Nat.sub_0_r. reflexivity.
    + simpl in *. rewrite IHn. reflexivity.
Qed.
```

Here is the explanation of the steps:

- We start by applying induction to `n`.
- For the base case (`n = 0`), the result is immediate by simplification.
- For the inductive case, we further case-analyze on `l1`. If `l1` is empty, the result follows by simplification and rewriting using the fact that `n - 0 = n`. If `l1` is not empty, the result follows by simplification and using the induction hypothesis.

User: good try. the corect proof is
 """"   Proof.
  induction n; intros l1 l2.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - destruct l1.
    + simpl. reflexivity.
    + simpl in *. rewrite IHn. reflexivity.
Qed. """"

CoqDog: Thank you for your correction. Indeed, in the case when l1 is empty, we don't need to rewrite using `Nat.sub_0_r`. Here's the corrected proof:

```coq
Lemma skipn_app n:
    forall l1 l2: list A,
      skipn n (l1 ++ l2) = (skipn n l1) ++ (skipn (n - length l1) l2).
Proof.
  induction n; intros l1 l2.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - destruct l1.
    + simpl. reflexivity.
    + simpl in *. rewrite IHn. reflexivity.
Qed.
```

We first apply induction on `n`. In the base case when `n = 0`, the proof follows directly from simplifying the expressions. In the inductive case, we examine `l1`. If `l1` is empty, the proof follows by simply simplifying the expressions. If `l1` is not empty, the proof follows by simplifying the expressions and applying the induction hypothesis.

CoqDog: Let's prove the lemma `firstn_append` using the `induction` tactic on list `l`. Please note that in this proof we do not need to use the previously proved lemma `skipn_app`.

Here are the steps explained:

- We apply induction on `l`.

 - remember to use any         previously proved lemmas in the context to prove the lemma when applicable.

CoqDog: To prove the lemma `skipn_append`, we can use induction on the list `l`. Note that we don't need to use the previously proved lemma `firstn_append` in this case.

The proof is structured as follows:

```coq
Lemma skipn_append: forall l l': list A, skipn (length l) (l ++ l') = l'.
Proof.
  induction l; intros l'.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. apply IHl.

```

Here is the explanation of the steps:

- We apply induction on `l`.
- In the base case, when `l` is an empty list, the result follows directly from simplification.
- In the inductive case, we have a list `a :: l` where `a` is the head of `l`. We simplify the expressions and apply the induction hypothesis to complete the proof.

User: Excellent. now proof that "" Lemma skipn_all: forall l: list A, skipn (length l) l = [].""

CoqDog: To prove the lemma `skipn_all`, we can again use induction on the list `l`.

Here is the proof:

```coq
Lemma skipn_all: forall l: list A, skipn (length l) l = [].
Proof.
  induction l.
  - simpl. reflexivity.
  - simpl. apply IHl.

Here is the explanation of the steps:

- We apply induction on `l`.
- In the base case, when `l` is an empty list, the result follows directly from simplification.
- In the inductive case, we have a list `a :: l` where `a` is the head of `l`. We simplify the expressions and apply the induction hypothesis to complete the proof.

User: Excellent. now prove that " Lemma skipn_nil: forall i, @skipn A i [] = []."

CoqDog: To prove the lemma `skipn_nil`, we can use induction on `i`.

Here is a possible proof:

```coq
Lemma skipn_nil: forall i, @skipn A i [] = [].
Proof.
  induction i.

Here are the steps explained:

- We apply induction on `i`.
- In the base case, when `i = 0`, the result follows directly from simplification.
- In the inductive case, we have `S i` where `S` is the successor function. We simplify the expressions and apply the induction hypothesis to complete the proof.

User: good try. Here is the corrected proof 
"""  Proof.

CoqDog: Thank you for the correction. Indeed, whether `i` is `0` or an increment of another natural number, the result of applying `skipn` to an empty list will always be an empty list.

 - remember to use any         previously proved lemmas in the context to prove the lemma when applicable.

CoqDog: Let's prove this lemma `firstn_all_n` by induction on `l`, the provided list. Note that we don't need any of the previously proved lemmas in this context to prove the current lemma.

Here is a possible proof:

```coq

```

Here is the explanation of the steps:

- We apply induction on `l`.
- In the base case, when `l` is an empty list, the result follows directly from simplification.
- In the inductive case, we have a list `a :: l` where `a` is the head of `l`. We destruct `n` to handle the cases when `n` is `0` and when `n` is the successor of another natural number. If `n` is `0`, we derive a contradiction from `Hlen` because the length of `l` cannot be less than or equal to `0`. If `n` is the successor of another natural number, we rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis and simplify `Hlen` to apply the hypothesis.

User: Good try. Use to use induction and firstn_nil and le_S_n and lia and remember to use hypothesis appropriately. 

CoqDog: Thank you for the hint. We can indeed prove this lemma using induction on `l`, the provided list, and using the lemma `firstn_nil` along with the `le_S_n` and `lia` tactics. Here is the corrected proof:

```coq
Lemma firstn_all_n: forall (l: list A) n, length l <= n -> firstn n l = l.
Proof.
  induction l as [| a l IH]; intros n H.

  - destruct n.
    + inversion H.
    + simpl. f_equal. apply IH. simpl in H. apply le_S_n in H. exact H.

```

In this proof:

- We apply induction on `l`.
- In the base case, when `l` is an empty list, we apply the previously proved lemma `firstn_nil`.
- In the inductive case, we destruct `n` to handle the cases when `n` is `0` and when `n` is the successor of another natural number. If `n` is `0`, we derive a contradiction from `H` because the length of `l` cannot be less than or equal to `0`. If `n` is the successor of another natural number, we rewrite the goal using the induction hypothesis, simplify `H` using `le_S_n`, and apply the newly simplified hypothesis. The `f_equal` tactic is used to apply the induction hypothesis to the subgoal after simplification.

User: Excellent. Now proof
 ""   Lemma skipn_all_n:

CoqDog: Let's prove this lemma `skipn_all_n` by induction on `l`, the provided list. We will use the lemmas `skipn_nil` and `le_S_n`, and the `lia` tactic. Here is the proof:

In this proof:

- We apply induction on `l`.
- In the base case, when `l` is an empty list, we apply the previously proved lemma `skipn_nil`.
- In the inductive case, we destruct `n` to handle the cases when `n` is `0` and when `n` is the successor of another natural number. If `n` is `0`, we derive a contradiction from `H` because the length of `l` cannot be less than or equal to `0`. If `n` is the successor of another natural number, we apply the induction hypothesis, simplify `H` using `le_S_n`, and apply the newly simplified hypothesis.

User: Excellent. Now prove that """ Lemma firstn_in: forall x i (l: list A),In x (firstn i l) -> In x l. """ remember to use induction, destruction, and use your hypothesis appropriately. 

CoqDog: To prove this lemma `firstn_in`, we can use induction on `i`, the index, and destruct on `l`, the list. Here is the proof:

```coq

In this proof:

- We apply induction on `i`.
- In the base case, when `i = 0`, the result follows directly as `firstn 0 l` is an empty list, and `x` cannot be a member of an empty list.
- In the inductive case, we destruct `l` to handle the cases when `l` is an empty list and when `l` is a non-empty list. If `l` is an empty list, the result is obtained directly as `x` cannot be a member of an empty list. If `l` is a non-empty list, we destruct `H` to handle the cases when `x` is the head of the list and when `x` is in the tail of the list. If `x` is the head of the list, `x` is trivially a member of `l`. If `x` is in the tail of the list, we apply the induction hypothesis.

User: Excellent. Now prove that """  Lemma skipn_in: forall x i (l: list A), In x (skipn i l) -> In x l.""" remember to use induction, destruction, and hypothesis appropriately. 

CoqDog: To prove this lemma `skipn_in`, we can use induction on `i`, the index, and destruct on `l`, the list. Here is the proof:

In this proof:

- We apply induction on `i`.
- In the base case, when `i = 0`, the result follows directly as `skipn 0 l = l`, so if `x` is a member of `l`, it is trivially a member of `l`.
- In the inductive case, we destruct `l` to handle the cases when `l` is an empty list and when `l` is a non-empty list. If `l` is an empty list, the result is obtained directly as `x` cannot be a member of an empty list. If `l` is a non-empty list, we apply the induction hypothesis.

User: Excellent. now prove that " Lemma skipn_zero: forall l: list A, skipn 0 l = l."

CoqDog: Sure, this lemma `skipn_zero` can be proved directly by simplification as `skipn 0 l` is defined to be `l` for any list `l`. Here is the proof:

```coq
Lemma skipn_zero: forall l: list A, skipn 0 l = l.
Proof.
  intros l. simpl. reflexivity.

In this proof:

- We introduce `l`.
- We simplify the expression `skipn 0 l` which results in `l`.
- We conclude that `skipn 0 l = l` by reflexivity.

User: Excellent. """ Lemma in_skipn_cons: forall i x y (l: list A), In x (skipn i l) -> In x (skipn i (y :: l))."""

CoqDog: To prove this lemma `in_skipn_cons`, we can use induction on `i`, the index. Here is the proof:

In this proof:

- We apply induction on `i`.
- In the base case, when `i = 0`, the result follows directly as `skipn 0 l = l` and `skipn 0 (y :: l) = y :: l`, so if `x` is a member of `l`, it is also a member of `y :: l`.
- In the inductive case, we apply the induction hypothesis.

User: Good try. Remember to induction,  skipn_zero, destruct and hypothesis appropriately.  

CoqDog: Thank you for your guidance. We can prove this lemma `in_skipn_cons` using induction on `i`, the index, and the lemma `skipn_zero`. Here is the corrected proof:

In this proof:

- We introduce `i`, `x`, `y`, `l`, and `H`.
- We destruct `i` to handle the cases when `i` is `0` and when `i` is the successor of another natural number. 
- If `i` is `0`, the result follows directly as `skipn 0 l = l` and `skipn 0 (y :: l) = y :: l`, so if `x` is a member of `l`, it is also a member of `y :: l`.
- If `i` is the successor of another natural number, we apply the hypothesis `H`.

User: you did not use skipn_zero. try again and don't for get to use it.

CoqDog: Apologies for the confusion. I see now where `skipn_zero` can be applied. Here's the corrected proof:

- We destruct `i` to handle the cases when `i` is `0` and when `i` is the successor of another natural number. 
- If `i` is `0`, we simplify and then rewrite `H` using `skipn_zero`. The result follows directly as `skipn 0 l = l` and `skipn 0 (y :: l) = y :: l`, so if `x` is a member of `l`, it is also a member of `y :: l`.

- If `i` is `0`, we simplify the goal and the hypothesis `H`, then conclude that if `x` is a member of `l`, it is also a member of `y :: l`.
- If `i` is the successor of another natural number, we further destruct `l` and simplify the goal and the hypothesis `H` in both cases. We conclude that if `x` is in `skipn i l`, it is also in `skipn i (y :: l)`.

User: prove that "  Definition disjoint_lists (l l': list A): Prop :=
    forall x, In x l -> In x l' -> False."

CoqDog: The statement you've given, "Definition disjoint_lists (l l': list A): Prop := forall x, In x l -> In x l' -> False.", is a definition, not a lemma or a theorem, so it doesn't need to be proved. It's defining the concept of disjoint_lists, which says that for any element `x`, if `x` is in list `l` and `x` is in list `l'`, then we derive a contradiction, implying that the lists `l` and `l'` are disjoint. 

If you want to use this definition in the context of a lemma or theorem, you would state that lemma or theorem and then use this definition as part of your proof. For example, you might have a lemma that says: "If `l` and `l'` are disjoint_lists, then for all `x` in `l`, `x` is not in `l'`", and you would prove that lemma using the definition of `disjoint_lists`. 

Please provide the lemma or theorem you would like to prove that uses this definition.

In this proof:

- We apply induction on `l`.
- In the base case, when `l` is an empty list, the result follows directly from the assumption that `l'` has no duplicates.
- In the inductive case, we have a list `a :: l` where `a` is the head of `l`. We apply the `NoDup_cons` constructor to the list `a :: (l ++ l')`. For the first argument of `NoDup_cons`, we show that `a` is not in `l ++ l'` using our assumptions about `l` and `l'` and the definition of `disjoint_lists`. For the second argument of `NoDup_cons`, we apply the induction hypothesis to `l` with the appropriate updated assumptions.

In this proof:

- We introduce `x`, `y`, `z`, and `l`.
- We apply the `split` tactic to handle the two directions of the equivalence separately.
- In the first direction, we use `in_app_or` to split the hypothesis `H` into two cases: one where `x` is in `y :: l` and one where `x` is in `[z]`. We handle each case separately using `destruct`.
- In the second direction, we use `in_or_app` to rewrite the goal into two cases: one where `x` is in `y :: l` and one where `x` is in `[z]`. We handle each case separately using `destruct`.

User: nice try. but use rewriting "app_comm_cons" an "in_app_iff" as needed. 

CoqDog: Thank you for your guidance. We can indeed make the proof clearer by using the `app_comm_cons` and `in_app_iff` lemmas. Here is the corrected proof:

```coq

- In the first direction, we rewrite the hypothesis `H` using `app_comm_cons` and `in_app_iff`, and then split it into cases using `destruct`.
- In the second direction, we split the hypothesis `H` into cases using `destruct`, and then in each case, we rewrite the goal using `app_comm_cons` and `in_app_iff`.

User: Excellent. now prove that """   Definition earlier (l: list A) (x y: A) := exists n, In x (firstn n l) /\  In y (skipn n l)."""

CoqDog: To prove this definition `earlier`, we can simply provide the definition as an axiom since it is not a lemma or theorem that requires proof. By stating it as an axiom, we assume its existence without providing a proof. Here is the axiom:

```coq
Axiom earlier : list A -> A -> A -> Prop.
```

The axiom `earlier` defines a predicate that takes a list `l` and two elements `x` and `y` as arguments. It states that there exists an index `n` such that `x` is in the first `n` elements of `l` (`firstn n l`) and `y` is in the remaining elements of `l` after skipping the first `n` elements (`skipn n l`).

Please note that axioms should be used with caution as they can introduce inconsistencies or non-constructive reasoning. It is generally preferable to prove properties rather than relying on axioms.

User: Sorry, I meant given the previous definition prove that "   Lemma earlier_in_left: forall l x y, earlier l x y -> In x l."

CoqDog: No problem! Let's prove the lemma `earlier_in_left` using the definition of `earlier`. Here is the proof:

```coq
Lemma earlier_in_left: forall l x y, earlier l x y -> In x l.
Proof.
  intros l x y H.
  unfold earlier in H.
  destruct H as [n [Hx _]].
  apply firstn_in with (i:=n) in Hx.
  assumption.
Qed.
```

In this proof:

- We introduce `l`, `x`, `y`, and `H`.
- We unfold the definition of `earlier` to expose the existential quantifier.
- We use the `destruct` tactic to obtain an index `n` and the two conditions `Hx` and `_` from the existential quantifier.
- We apply the lemma `firstn_in` with the argument `i:=n` to derive `In x l` from `In x (firstn n l)`.
- Finally, we use `assumption` to complete the proof by asserting that `In x l` holds.

User: Excellent. Prove that "Lemma earlier_in_right: forall l x y, earlier l x y -> In y l."

CoqDog: Certainly! Let's prove the lemma `earlier_in_right` using the definition of `earlier`. Here is the proof:

In this proof:

- We introduce `l`, `x`, `y`, and `H`.
- We unfold the definition of `earlier` to expose the existential quantifier.
- We use the `destruct` tactic to obtain an index `n` and the two conditions `_` and `Hy` from the existential quantifier.
- We apply the lemma `skipn_in` with the argument `i:=n` to derive `In y l` from `In y (skipn n l)`.

User: Excellent. Now prove that "  Lemma earlier_left:forall p q x y, earlier p x y -> earlier (p ++ q) x y."

CoqDog: To prove the lemma `earlier_left`, we can use the definition of `earlier` and properties of `firstn` and `skipn`. Here is the proof:

Proof.
  intros p q x y H.

  - apply in_or_app. left. assumption.
  - apply in_or_app. right. assumption.

```

In this proof:

- We introduce `p`, `q`, `x`, `y`, and `H`.
- We unfold the definition of `earlier` to expose the existential quantifier.
- We use the `destruct` tactic to obtain an index `n` and the conditions `Hx` and `Hy` from the existential quantifier.
- We use the `exists` tactic to provide the same index `n` and the `split` tactic to split the goal into two subgoals.
- In the first subgoal, we use `in_or_app` and `left` to show that `x` is in `p ++ q` by showing that it is in `p`.
- In the second subgoal, we use `in_or_app` and `right` to show that `y` is in `p ++ q` by showing that it is in `q`.
- Finally, we have proven that if `x` is in the first `n` elements of `p` and `y` is in the remaining elements of `p`, then `x` is in the first `n` elements of `p ++ q` and `y` is in the remaining elements of `p ++ q`.

User: Try again, It would be better to remember to use rewrite firstn_app and skipn_app also you can apply in_or_app, when possible

CoqDog: Apologies for the oversight. Let's prove the lemma `earlier_left` using the `earlier` definition and the lemmas `firstn_app` and `skipn_app`.

- In the first subgoal, we rewrite the expression `firstn n (p ++ q)` using the lemma `firstn_app` and apply `in_or_app` to show that `x` is in `p ++ q` by showing that it is in `p`.
- In the second subgoal, we rewrite the expression `skipn n (p ++ q)` using the lemma `skipn_app` and apply `in_or_app` to show that `y` is in `p ++ q` by showing that it is in `q`.

In this proof:

- We introduce `x`, `y`, `l`, and `l'`.
- We split the proof into two directions using the `split` tactic.
- In the first direction, we assume `earlier (l ++ l') x y` and proceed to show the three possible cases: `earlier l x y`, `In x l /\ In y l'`, and `earlier l' x y`. We use the provided strategy and apply the appropriate lemmas to rewrite the expressions and obtain the desired results.
- In the second direction, we assume `earlier l x y \/ In x l /\ In y l' \/ earlier l' x y` and proceed to show that each case implies `earlier (l ++ l') x y`. We use the provided strategy and apply the appropriate lemmas to rewrite the expressions and obtain the desired results.
- Finally, we have proven that `earlier (l ++ l') x y` is equivalent to `earlier l x y \/ In x l /\ In y l' \/ earlier l' x y`.

User:  prove that " Lemma earlier_cons: forall p x y, In y p -> earlier (x :: p) x y." 

CoqDog: To prove the lemma `earlier_cons`, we can use the definition of `earlier` and the properties of `firstn` and `skipn`. Here is the proof:

```coq
Lemma earlier_cons: forall p x y, In y p -> earlier (x :: p) x y.
Proof.
  intros p x y H.
  unfold earlier.
  exists 1.
  split.
  - simpl. left. reflexivity.
  - simpl. assumption.
Qed.
```

In this proof:

- We introduce `p`, `x`, `y`, and `H`.
- We unfold the definition of `earlier` to expose the existential quantifier.
- We use the `exists` tactic to provide the index `1` and apply the `split` tactic to split the goal into two subgoals.
- In the first subgoal, we simplify the expression `firstn 1 (x :: p)` to just `[x]` using the `simpl` tactic.
- In the second subgoal, we simplify the expression `skipn 1 (x :: p)` to just `p` using the `simpl` tactic.
- Finally, we have proven that if `y` is in `p`, then `x` is in the first element of `x :: p`, and `y` is in the remaining elements of `x :: p`, establishing the `earlier` relationship.
