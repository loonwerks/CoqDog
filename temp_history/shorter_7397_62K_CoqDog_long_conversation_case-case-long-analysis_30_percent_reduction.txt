CoqDog: Sure, let's use the previous proof of `inv_recon_mt` and simplify it based on the provided context.

```coq
Lemma inv_recon_mt: forall ls et,

Proof.

Here's the detailed reasoning:

1. `intros ls et H.` introduces the variables and the hypothesis.
2. `invc H.` inverts the hypothesis `reconstruct_evP (evc ls et) mtc`.
3. `destruct et;` destructs the evidence type `et`.
4. `repeat ff;` simplifies the goal by breaking matches and unfolding definitions.
5. `try (unfold OptMonad_Coq.bind in *);` unfolds the monadic bind operation.
6. `repeat ff;` repeats the simplification.
7. `try solve_by_inversion.` tries to solve the goal by inversion.
8. `eauto.` finishes the proof using automated tactics.

This approach ensures we are leveraging the context effectively and maintaining clarity in the proof.

3. **Final Step**:

Explanation:

1. **Introduction and Inversion**:
   ```coq
   intros p ps ls et n ec' H.
   invc H.
   ```
   This introduces variables and the hypothesis, then inverts the hypothesis `reconstruct_evP (evc ls et) (eec p ps n ec')`.

2. **Destruct and Simplify**:
   ```coq
   destruct et; repeat ff; try (unfold OptMonad_Coq.bind in *); repeat ff; destruct ls; try solve_by_inversion.
   ```
   This destructs the evidence type `et` and proceeds with simplification by breaking matches and unfolding definitions. The `try solve_by_inversion` attempts to solve the goal by inversion if possible. The additional `destruct ls` ensures that `ls` is a singleton list `[n]`.

3. **Final Step**:
   ```coq
   - exists et.
     split; reflexivity.
   ```
   This ensures that the resulting conditions `et = uu p ENCR ps et'` and `ls = [n]` are satisfied, finishing the proof.

The proof is concise and leverages the provided context effectively.

User: Thanks. Try to benefit from the correct proofs I provided to as appropriate. Here is a hint, use the tactic "repeat eexists".  

CoqDog: Certainly! Let's prove the `inv_recon_ee` lemma by leveraging the proof strategies from the previous lemmas and using the `repeat eexists` tactic to handle the existential quantifiers.

Here's the proof for `inv_recon_ee`:

```coq
Lemma inv_recon_ee: forall p ps ls et n ec',
    reconstruct_evP (evc ls et) (eec p ps n ec') ->
    (exists et', et = uu p ENCR ps et' /\ ls = [n]).
Proof.
  intros p ps ls et n ec' H.
  invc H.
  destruct et; repeat ff; try (unfold OptMonad_Coq.bind in *); repeat ff; try solve_by_inversion.
  - repeat eexists.
    destruct ls; ff.

```

   This introduces variables and the hypothesis, then inverts the hypothesis `reconstruct_evP (evc ls et) (eec p ps n ec')`.

2. **Destruct and Simplify**:
   ```coq

3. **Final Step**:
   ```coq
   - repeat eexists.
     destruct ls; ff.
   ```
   This uses the `repeat eexists` tactic to handle the existential quantifiers and ensures that `et = uu p ENCR ps et'` and `ls = [n]` are satisfied, finishing the proof.

Explanation:

1. **Introduction and Generalization**:
   ```coq
   intros e e0 e1 H.
   generalizeEverythingElse e1.
   ```
   This introduces variables and the hypothesis, then generalizes `e1` to handle induction on its structure.

2. **Induction and Inversion**:
   ```coq
   induction e1; intros; invc H; repeat ff; try (unfold OptMonad_Coq.bind in *); repeat ff; try solve_by_inversion.
   ```
   This applies induction on `e1`, inverts the hypothesis `reconstruct_evP (evc e0 e1) e`, and simplifies the goal by breaking matches, unfolding definitions, and attempting to solve by inversion if possible.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `mt`**:
     ```coq
     destruct e; repeat ff; try solve_by_inversion.
     reflexivity.
     ```
     This handles the case where `et` is `mt` and ensures that `e` is `mtc`.
   
   - **Case `uu`**:
     ```coq
     destruct f; repeat ff; try (unfold OptMonad_Coq.bind in *); repeat ff; try solve_by_inversion.
     ```
     This handles the case where `et` is `uu` and matches on the forwarding type `f`.
     - **Case `EXTD`**:
       ```coq
       destruct e; repeat ff; try solve_by_inversion.
       apply IHe1 in H1.
       rewrite H1.
       reflexivity.
       ```
       This ensures that the evidence type matches and uses the induction hypothesis to complete the proof.
     - **Case `COMP`, `ENCR`, `KILL`, `KEEP`**:
       ```coq
       destruct e; repeat ff; try solve_by_inversion.
       reflexivity.
       ```
       These cases handle the respective forwarding types and ensure that the reconstruction holds.

   - **Case `nn`**:
     ```coq
     destruct e; repeat ff; try solve_by_inversion.
     reflexivity.
     ```
     This handles the case where `et` is `nn` and ensures that `e` is `nnc`.

   - **Case `ss`**:
     ```coq
     destruct e; repeat ff; try (unfold OptMonad_Coq.bind in *); repeat ff; try solve_by_inversion.
     apply IHe1_1 in H1.
     apply IHe1_2 in H2.
     rewrite H1.
     rewrite H2.

CoqDog: Thank you for the detailed proof. Here is the corrected proof for `etfun_reconstruct` using the approach you provided:

Explanation:

1. **Introduction and Generalization**:
   ```coq
   intros e e0 e1 H.
   generalizeEverythingElse e1.
   ```
   This introduces variables and the hypothesis, then generalizes `e1` to handle induction on its structure.

2. **Induction and Inversion**:
   ```coq
   induction e1; intros; invc H; repeat ff; try (unfold OptMonad_Coq.bind in *); repeat ff; try solve_by_inversion.
   ```
   This applies induction on `e1`, inverts the hypothesis `reconstruct_evP (evc e0 e1) e`, and simplifies the goal by breaking matches, unfolding definitions, and attempting to solve by inversion if possible.

3. **Case Analysis**:
   - **Case `mt`**:
     ```coq
     reflexivity.
     ```
     This handles the case where `et` is `mt` and ensures that `e` is `mtc`.
   
   - **Case `uu`**:
     ```coq
     assert (e1 = et_fun e2).
     {
       eapply IHe1.
       econstructor.
       symmetry.
       eassumption.
     }
     congruence.
     ```
     This handles the case where `et` is `uu` and matches on the forwarding type `f`. It uses the induction hypothesis to complete the proof and `congruence` to handle the equality check.

   - **Case `nn`**:
     ```coq
     assert (e1 = et_fun e2).
     {
       eapply IHe1.
       econstructor.
       symmetry.
       eassumption.
     }
     congruence.
     ```
     This handles the case where `et` is `nn` and ensures that `e` is `nnc`.

   - **Case `ss`**:
     ```coq
     repeat ff; try (unfold OptMonad_Coq.bind in * ); repeat ff.
     assert (e1_1 = et_fun e1).
     {
       eapply IHe1_1.
       econstructor.
       symmetry.
       eassumption.
     }
     assert (e1_2 = et_fun e2).
     {
       eapply IHe1_2.
       econstructor.
       symmetry.
       eassumption.
     }
     congruence.
     ```
     This handles the case where `et` is `ss` and ensures that the sub-evidence types match, using the induction hypotheses to complete the proof and `congruence` to handle the equality check.

The proof leverages the provided context effectively, is detailed, and handles each case appropriately.
