Here's how you can do it:\n\n```coq\nLemma one_plus_one_equals_two : 1 + 1 = 2.\nProof.\n  simpl.\n  reflexivity.\nQed.\n```\n\nIn this proof, we use the `simpl` tactic to simplify the left-hand side of the equality to `2`. Then we use the `reflexivity` tactic to finish the proof, since `2 = 2` is obviously true."
