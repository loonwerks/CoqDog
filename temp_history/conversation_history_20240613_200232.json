Assuming we have access to basic arithmetic properties, we can prove this lemma as follows:\n\n```coq\nlemma 1_plus_1 : 1 + 1 = 2.\nProof.\n  reflexivity.\nQed.\n```\n\nHere is an explanation of the steps:\n- `reflexivity` is a tactic that closes the goal if both sides of the equation are identical after simplification. In this case, `1 + 1` simplifies to `2`, making both sides of the equation `2`.\n\nIf you have any specific context or additional definitions you want to include, please provide them, and I can refine the proof accordingly."
